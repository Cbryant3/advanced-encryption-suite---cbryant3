# Advanced Encryption Suite

A modular Python-based encryption and decryption toolkit supporting both classical and modern cryptographic algorithms. This project is designed for learning, demonstration, and extension of ciphers, hashing, and encryption modes.


🔐 Features

Classical Ciphers

| Cipher          | Encrypt | Decrypt | Brute Force | Notes                         |
| --------------- | :-----: | :-----: | :---------: | ----------------------------- |
| Caesar Cipher   |    ✅    |    ✅    |      ✅      | Integer key                   |
| Substitution    |    ✅    |    ✅    |      ➖      | Supports permutation mapping  |
| Transposition   |    ✅    |    ✅    |      ➖      | Simple & double transposition |
| Vigenère Cipher |    ✅    |    ✅    |      ➖      | Keyword-based encryption      |


Modern Symmetric Encryption (via PyCryptodome)

| Algorithm | Modes Supported | Key Type         |
| --------: | --------------- | ---------------- |
|       AES | ECB, CBC, CFB   | Default/test key |
|       DES | ECB, CBC, CFB   | Default/test key |
|      3DES | ECB, CBC, CFB   | Default/test key |

Hashing & Examples

Simple SHA-256 hashing

SHA collision/statistical testing (optional plotting)


🛠️ Planned Improvements

Add GUI interface

Add RSA / public key cryptography

Add file encryption support

Improve test coverage

Implement brute-force solver for Substitution & Transposition
