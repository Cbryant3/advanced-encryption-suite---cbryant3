# Encryption Projects and Work – Cameron Bryant (CS 485)

A comprehensive collection of encryption and information security projects originally developed for **CS 485 – Information Security** and later refactored for real-world and portfolio readiness.  
This repository showcases multiple **encryption, decryption, hashing, and cryptographic mode implementations**, all written in **Python** with a command-line interface for user interaction.

## 🔐 **Implemented Cryptographic Algorithms**

### **Symmetric Key Algorithms**
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** – supports ECB, CBC, CFB, and OFB modes
- **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**
- **3DES (Triple DES)**

### **Classical Encryption Techniques**
- **Caesar Cipher**
- **Vigenère Cipher**
- **Permutation Cipher**
- **Transposition Cipher**

### **Hashing**
- **SHA-256**
